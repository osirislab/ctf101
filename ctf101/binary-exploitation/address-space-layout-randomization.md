# Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)

Address Space Layout Randomization (or ASLR) is the randomization of the place in memory where the program, shared libraries, the stack, and the heap are. This makes can make it harder for an attacker to exploit a service, as knowledge about where the stack, heap, or libc can't be re-used between program launches. This is a partially effective way of preventing an attacker from jumping to, for example, libc without a leak.

Typically, only the stack, heap, and shared libraries are ASLR enabled. It is still somewhat rare for the main program to have ASLR enabled, though it is being seen more frequently and is slowly becoming the default.
