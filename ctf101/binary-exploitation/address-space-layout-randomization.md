# Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)

Address Space Layout Randomization or ASLR is the method of randomizing where in memory the program is loaded in, making it hard for an attacker to guess where exactly the program's code is being loaded in. This is a partially effective way of preventing an attacker from jumping to, for example, lib c to a shell without a memory leak.
