# Binary Exploitation

Binaries, or executables, are machine code for a computer to execute. For the most part, the binaries that you will face in CTFs are linux ELF files or the occasional windows executable. Binary Exploitation is a broad topic within Cyber Security which really comes down to finding a vulnerability in the program and exploiting it to gain control of a shell or modifying the program's functions.

Common topics addressed by Binary Exploitation or 'pwn' challenges include:

* [Buffers](/binary-exploitation/what-are-buffers/)
    * [Buffer Overflow](/binary-exploitation/buffer-overflow/)
* [The Stack](/binary-exploitation/what-is-the-stack/)
* [Registers](/binary-exploitation/what-are-registers/)
* [Calling Conventions](/binary-exploitation/what-are-calling-conventions/)
