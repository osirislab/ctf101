# Binary Exploitation

Binaries, or executables, are machine code for a computer to execute. For the most part, the binaries that you will face in CTFs are Linux ELF files or the occasional windows executable. Binary Exploitation is a broad topic within Cyber Security which really comes down to finding a vulnerability in the program and exploiting it to gain control of a shell or modifying the program's functions.

Common topics addressed by Binary Exploitation or 'pwn' challenges include:

* [Registers](/binary-exploitation/what-are-registers/)
* [The Stack](/binary-exploitation/what-is-the-stack/)
* [Calling Conventions](/binary-exploitation/what-are-calling-conventions/)
* [Global Offset Table (GOT)](/binary-exploitation/what-is-the-got/)
* [Buffers](/binary-exploitation/what-are-buffers/)
    * [Buffer Overflow](/binary-exploitation/buffer-overflow/)
* [Return Oriented Programming (ROP)](/binary-exploitation/return-oriented-programming/)
* [Binary Security](/binary-exploitation/what-is-binary-security/)
    * [No eXecute (NX)](/binary-exploitation/no-execute/)
    * [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](/binary-exploitation/address-space-layout-randomization/)
    * [Stack Canaries](/binary-exploitation/stack-canaries/)
    * [Relocation Read-Only (RELRO)](/binary-exploitation/relocation-read-only/)
