# GOT

The Global Offset Table (or GOT) is a section inside of programs that holds addresses of functions that are dynamically linked. As mentioned in the page on [calling conventions](./what-are-calling-conventions), most programs don't include every function they use to reduce binary size. Instead, common functions (like those in libc) are "linked" into the program so they can be saved once on disk and reused by every program.

Unless a program is marked [full RELRO](./relocation-read-only), the resolution of function to address in dynamic library is done lazily. All dynamic libraries are loaded into memory along with the main program at launch, however functions are not mapped to their actual code until they're first called. For example, in the following C snippet `puts` won't be resolved to an address in libc until after it has been called once:

```c
int main() {
    puts("Hi there!");
    puts("Ok bye now.");
    return 0;
}
```

To avoid searching through shared libraries each time a function is called, the result of the lookup is saved into the GOT so future function calls "short circuit" straight to their implementation bypassing the dynamic resolver.

This has two important implications:

1. The GOT contains pointers to libraries which move around due to [ASLR](./address-space-layout-randomization)
2. The GOT is writable

These two facts will become very useful to use in [Return Oriented Programming](./return-oriented-programming)


## PLT

Before a functions address has been resolved, the GOT points to an entry in the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT). This is a small "stub" function which is responsible for calling the dynamic linker with (effectively) the name of the function that should be resolved.
