## Description
Play a 3v1 chess game against Kevin.
If you want to play just let Kevin know. We can set the boards up.
Here are the rules:
- The standard rules of chess
- Kevin plays 3 boards at once against 3 players from a team
- A team can play at most 3 times an hour but it is still up to Kevin to accept or decline a challenge or even enforce this rule
- You may not use an engine or other computer support. Only the players sitting at the table may provide moves
- Kevin has 7 minutes on each board, each competitor has 5 minutes. (To allow time to move between boards)
- Illegal moves that are called out are considered wins for either side
- Kevin always plays white
- The clock confirms the move meaning when you hit the clock you have confirmed your move and it is immutable
- You must win 2 out of the 3 games.
