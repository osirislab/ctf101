## Description
We found a manual for a strange old machine in our closet, as well as a ROM. Can you figure out if there is is any way to log onto it?

Note: The flag is marked with `flag{XXXXX...}` in memory, run against the remote instance to get the real flag!
## Flag
`flag{writing_disassemblers_is_fun}`
## Solution
[solve.py](solve.py)
## Setup
Distribute:
- `ct64_interpreter`
- `docs/CyberT.pdf` (or a printout)
- `distribute.rom`

Run with `flags.rom`
