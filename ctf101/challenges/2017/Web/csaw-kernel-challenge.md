NOTE: Login with your CTFd credentials.
NOTE: This might take a minute to start up the first time you login. Please be patient!
NOTE: There may be ways to poke at other teams' boxes. Don't do that, it is not part of the challenge.
NOTE: If you have issues with your instance, try logging out of the KWS interface, and logging back in.
