# Cryptography

Cryptography is the reason we can use banking apps, transmit sensitive information over the web, and in general protect our privacy. However, a large part of CTFs is breaking widely used encryption schemes which are improperly implemented. The math may seem daunting, but more often than not, a simple understanding of the underlying principles will allow you to find flaws and crack the code.

Several recurring topics within CTF Cryptography challenges includes:

 * [XOR](/cryptography/what-is-xor/)
 * [Cesear Cipher](/cryptography/what-is-caesar-cipher-rot-13/)
 * [Substitution Cipher](/cryptography/what-is-a-substitution-cipher/)
 * [Vigenere Cipher](/cryptography/what-is-a-vigenere-cipher/)
 * [Hashing Functions](/cryptography/what-are-hashing-functions/)
 * [Block Modes of Operation](/cryptography/what-are-block-modes-of-operation/)
 * [RSA](/cryptography/what-is-rsa/)
