# Cryptography

Cryptography is the reason we can use banking apps, transmit sensitive information over the web, and in general protect our privacy. However, a large part of CTFs is breaking widely used encryption schemes which are improperly implemented. The math may seem daunting, but more often than not, a simple understanding of the underlying principles will allow you to find flaws and crack the code.

The word “cryptography” technically means the art of writing codes. When it comes to digital forensics, it’s a method you can use to understand how data is constructed for your analysis.

## What is cryptography used for?
**Legitimate uses**
- Securing web traffic (passwords, communication, etc.)
- Securing copyrighted software code

**Malicious uses**
- Hiding malicious communication
- Hiding malicious code
