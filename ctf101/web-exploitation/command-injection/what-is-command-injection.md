# Command Injection

Command Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to submit system commands to a website. This happens when the application fails to encode user input that goes into a system shell. It is very common to see this vulnerability when a developer uses the `system()` command or the equivalent way to run a system/shell command in a given programming language.

```python
import os

domain = user_input() # ctf101.org

os.system('ping ' + domain)
```

The above code when used normally will ping the `ctf101.org` domain.

But consider what would happen if the `user_input()` function returned different data?

```python
import os

domain = user_input() # ; ls

os.system('ping ' + domain)
```

Under this input, the code will do two things.

 1. Run the `ping` command (with no input)
 2. Run the `ls` command

Because of the additional semicolon, the `os.system()` function is instructed to run two commands.

This is the core concept behind command injection. The `ls` command could of course be switched with another command (e.g. wget, curl, bash, etc.)

Command injection is a very common means of privelege escalation within web applications and applications that interface with system commands.


## Example Payloads

 * <code>;ls</code>
 * <code>$(ls)</code>
 * <code>\`ls\`</code>
