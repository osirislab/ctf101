# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross Site Scripting or XSS is a vulnerability where on user of an application can send JavaScript that is executed by the browser of another user of the same application.

This is a vulnerability because JavaScript has a high degree of control over a user's web browser.

For example JavaScript has the ability to:

  * Modify the page (called the DOM)
  * Send more HTTP requests
  * Access cookies

By combining all of these abilities, XSS can maliciously use JavaScript to extract user's cookies and send them to an attacker controlled server. XSS can also modify the DOM to phish users for their passwords. This only scratches the surface of what XSS can be used to do.

XSS is typically broken down into three categories:

 * Reflected XSS
 * Stored XSS
 * DOM XSS
