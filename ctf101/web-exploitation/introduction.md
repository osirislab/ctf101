# Web Exploitation

Websites all around the world are programmed using various programming languages. While there are specific vulnerabilities in each programming langage that the developer should be aware of, there are issues fundamental to the internet that can show up regardless of the chosen language or framework.

These vulnerabilities often show up in CTFs as web security challenges where the user needs to exploit a bug to gain some kind of higher level privelege.

Common vulnerabilities to see in CTF challenges:

 * SQL Injection
 * Directory Traversal
 * Command Injection
 * Server Side Request Forgery
 * Cross Site Scripting
 * Cross Site Request Forgery
