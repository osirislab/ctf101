# Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Server Side Request Forgery is similar to CSRF, but instead of the client being a victim, in this case the server itself is the target of the attack. Where CSRF dealt with using other user's credentials, SSRF is involved in the modifiation of URL's which transfer data, publish data, read data, or otherwise involve internal resources. By manipulating the URL, the attacker is exploiting the outcome of the server's action to extract cloud metadata, connect HTTP databases, read files, or manipulate internal REST interfaces.
