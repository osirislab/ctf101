# Registers

A **register** is a location within the processor that is able to store data, much like RAM. Unlike RAM however, accesses to registers are effectively instantaneous, whereas reads from main memory can take hundreds of CPU cycles to return.

Registers can hold any value: addresses (pointers), results from mathematical operations, characters, etc. Some registers are _reserved_ however, meaning they have a special purpose and are not "general purpose registers" (GPRs). On x86, the only 2 reserved registers are `rip` and `rsp` which hold the address of the next instruction to execute and the address of the [stack](./what-is-the-stack) respectively.

On x86, the same register can have different sized accesses for backwards compatability. For example, the `rax` register is the full 64-bit register, `eax` is the low 32 bits of `rax`, `ax` is the low 16 bits, `al` is the low 8 bits, and `ah` is the high 8 bits of `ax` (bits 8-16 of `rax`).
