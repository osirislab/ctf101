FLAG
       You can get the flag to this first part of the
       problem by getting  the  website  to  run  the
       get_flag1  command. I heard the admin likes to
       launch it when he visits his own profile.

SUPERHERO ORIGIN STORY
       I have deep-rooted problems
       That  involve  childhood  trauma  of  too many
       shells
       It was ksh, zsh, bash, dash
       They just never stopped
       On that day I swore I would have vengeance
       I became
       The Bashman
