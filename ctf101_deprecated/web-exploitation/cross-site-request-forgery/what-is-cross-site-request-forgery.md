# Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

A Cross Site Request Forgery or CSRF Attack, pronounced *see surf*, is an attack on an authenticated user which uses a state session in order to perform state changing attacks like a purchase, a transfer of funds, or a change of email address.

The entire premise of CSRF is based on session hijacking, usually by injecting malicious elements within a webpage through an `<img>` tag or an `<iframe>` where references to external resources are unverified.

## Using CSRF

`GET` requests are often used by websites to get user input. Say a user signs in to an banking site which assigns their browser a cookie which keeps them logged in. If they transfer some money, the URL that is sent to the server might have the pattern:

`http://securibank.com/transfer.do?acct=[RECEPIENT]&amount=[DOLLARS]`

Knowing this format, an attacker can send an email with a hyperlink to be clicked on or they can include an image tag of 0 by 0 pixels which will automatically be requested by the browser such as:

`<img src="http://securibank.com/transfer.do?acct=[RECEPIENT]&amount=[DOLLARS]" width="0" height="0" border="0">`
