# Buffers

A buffer is any allocated space in memory where data (often user input) can be stored. For example, in the following C program `name` would be considered a stack buffer:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char name[64] = {0};
    read(0, name, 63);
    printf("Hello %s", name);
    return 0;
}
```

Buffers could also be global variables:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char name[64] = {0};

int main() {
    read(0, name, 63);
    printf("Hello %s", name);
    return 0;
}
```

Or dynamically allocated on the [heap](./what-is-the-heap):

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char *name = malloc(64);
    memset(name, 0, 64);
    read(0, name, 63);
    printf("Hello %s", name);
    return 0;
}
```

## Exploits

Given that buffers commonly hold user input, mistakes when writing to them could result in attacker controlled data being written outside of the buffer's space. See the page on [buffer overflows](./buffer-overflow) for more.
