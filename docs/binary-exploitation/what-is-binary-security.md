Binary Security is using tools and methods in order to secure programs from being manipulated and exploited. This tools are not infallible, but when used together and implemented properly, they can raise the difficulty of exploitation greatly.

Some methods covered include:

* [No eXecute (NX)](/binary-exploitation/no-execute/)
* [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](/binary-exploitation/address-space-layout-randomization/)
* [Relocation Read-Only (RELRO)](/binary-exploitation/relocation-read-only/)
* [Stack Canaries/Cookies](/binary-exploitation/stack-canaries/)
