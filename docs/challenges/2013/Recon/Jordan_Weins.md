## Solution
1. The text on the challenge will say, "the trail starts where the trail ended"
2. Last year's key for me was on [http://key.psifertex.com/alternate-index.html](http://key.psifertex.com/alternate-index.html). In the HTML source will be a comment (not there now) that says, "Michael Vario sure does some suspicious signs, hope he doesn't do me."
3. Googling Michael Vario sign or mvario sign takes you to a number of interesting links, any number of which can give you enough hints. Here's one: [http://blog.client9.com/2013/07/fun-with-pgp-part-2.html](http://blog.client9.com/2013/07/fun-with-pgp-part-2.html) basically talking about GPG.
4. From there, it should be obvious to search for me on public keyservers. I'm debating which public keyserver I submit my stuff too, either MIT or the main round-robin on hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net.
5. I've created a key there with an image attachment that is a photo graph of a key{keyphrasehere} style CSAW key.
