## Flag
`flag{number2isalittlebitharder:p}`
## Solution
The second one has basically the same logic flow, however includes more anti-debugging techniques and more complex reversing issues.  In order to solve this one, the competitor will need to demonstrate a real understanding of what is going on in both binaries.  After they understand it, solving it is cake.  And once solved, the key resides in memory.
