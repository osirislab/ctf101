## Notes
If they need a hint, point them at: [http://www.cyber1.org/pterm.asp](http://www.cyber1.org/pterm.asp)

Forensics/Reverse Engineering challenge (not really RE since the source is given, but converting from the source and pcap to meaningful data requires some work. No idea on the difficulty here, should be playtested, or the scoreboard should adjust based on how many people solve or something.
