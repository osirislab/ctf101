## Description
Programming is hard. CTF software is hard too. We broke our CTF software a few years ago and looks like we did it again this year
:( :( :(
HINT: If you are smart about it, you do not need to attack the CTF infrastructure.
HINT: The source code of our CTF software is on our Github. Also if you tried the challenge with flag{} before, try again.
