## Additional Information
Terrible description, I know, but just bear with me on this explanation. "Canned" is supposed to hint at the possibility of multiple files existing in a single file. "epic hidden snek flavored" is supposed to somehow hint towards the [stepic module](http://domnit.org/stepic/doc/). Two Wikipedia articles which will help you out as well include [weak passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords) and [Base85](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85).
