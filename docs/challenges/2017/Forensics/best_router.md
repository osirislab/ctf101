## Solution
[external CTF writeup](https://dillonkorman.com/csaw-2017-best-router-writeup/)
## Setup
Distribute best_router.tar.gz. Warn users that it will expand into a large (16 GB) file.
NOTE: because the file is too big for github, it has been split with `split_file.sh`. Please run `join_file.sh` to recombine them. The resulting file should be called `best_router.tar.gz` and have a sha1sum of `0302bb56743d97ee999d510a0e99e0e0c5dd9004`
