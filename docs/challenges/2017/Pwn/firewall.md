## Additional Information

This is an exploitation challenge that is compiled for the old, Windows POSIX Subsystem.
To complete this challenge, it is expected that you are going to have to have to actually get the executable running in the SUA 4.0 (Subsystem for Unix Applications) environment. This subsystem was shipped as a part of Windows from NT 4.0 - Windows 8.
