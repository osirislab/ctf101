# Capture The Flag 101

## Overview

Capture the Flags, or CTFs, are computer security competitions. 

Teams of competitors (or just individuals) are pitted against each other in various challenges across multiple security disciplines, competing to earn the most points.

CTFs are often the beginning of one's cyber security career due to their team building nature and competetive aspect. In addition, there isn't a lot of commitment required beyond a weekend.

In this guide/wiki/handbook you'll learn the techniques, thought processes, and methodologies you need to succeed in Capture the Flag competitions.
