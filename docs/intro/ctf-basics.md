# How to get started
First of all, make sure to check out our [recommended software](/faq/recommended-software/) section. It's handy to have these tools installed and ready as you get to solving some CTFs.

Ideally, you must have :
- a decompiler like [Binja](https://binary.ninja)
- a debugger, [gdb](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/)
- a suite of web tools, [Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload), [sqlmap](https://sqlmap.org), and [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) are solid to begin with
- the essential python package [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/install.html) to interact with processes easily
