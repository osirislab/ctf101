# How do I run a CTF?

> "Is it really a CTF if you don't solve the infrastructure problem in the 24 hours before the competition?"

## Before you start

Consider a few of the following before starting a CTF.

- How many people will play in my CTF?
- What type of challenges do I want to write?
- How do you want to host your challenges?
- What is my budget?

## **Open Source Frameworks**
