# The C Programming Language

## History

The C programming language iwas written by Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s while he was working at Bell Labs. It was first used to reimplement the Unix operating system which was purely written in assembly language. At first, the Unix developers were considering using a language called "B" but because B wasn't optimized for the target computer, the C language was created.

!!! note
    C is the letter and the programming language after B!

C was designed to be close to assembly and is still widely used in lower level programming where speed and control are needed (operating systems, embedded systems). C was also very influential to other programming langauges used today. Notable languages include C++, Objective-C, Golang, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Rust.


## Hello World

C is an ancestor of many other programming languages and if you are familiar with programming, it's likely that C will be at least someewhat familiar.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```


## Today

Today C is widely used either as a low level programming langauge or is the base language that other programming languages are implemented in.

While it can be difficult to see, the C language compiles down directly into machine code. The compiler is programmed to process the provided C code and emit assembly that's targetted to whatever operating system and architecture the compiler is set to use.

Some common compilers include:

 * gcc
 * clang

A good way to explore this relationship is to use this online [GCC Explorer](https://godbolt.org/#) from Matt Godbolt.

In regards to CTF, many reverse engineering and exploitation CTF challenges are written in C because the language compiles down directly to assembly and there are little to no safeguards in the language. This means developers must manually handle both. Of course, this can lead to mistakes which can sometimes lead to security issues.

!!! note
    Other higher level langauges like Python manage memory and garbage collection for you. Google Golang was inspired by C but adds in functionality like garbage collection, and memory safety.

There are some examples of famously vulnerable functions in C which are still available and can still result in vulnerabilities:

 * `gets` - Can result in buffer overflows
 * `strcpy` - Can result in buffer overflows
 * `strcat` - Can result in buffer overflows
 * `strcmp` - Can result in timing attacks

## Types

C has four basic types:

 * char - characters
 * int - integers (e.g. 125)
 * float - 32 bit floating point number (e.g. 2.4)
 * double - 64 bit floating point number (like a float but more precise in terms of decimal points)

## Pointers

C uses an idea known as pointers. A pointer is a variable which contains the address of another variable.

To understand this idea we should first understand that memory is laid out in terms of addresses and data gets stored at these addresses.

Take the following example of defining an integer in C:

```c
int x = 4;
```

To the programmer this is the variable `x` receiving the value of 4. The computer stores this value in some location in memory. For example we can say that address `0x1000` now holds the value `4`. The computer knows to directly access the memory and retrieve the value `4` whenever the programmer tries to use the `x` variable. If we were to say `x + 4`, the computer would give you `8` instead of `0x1004`.

But in C we can retrieve the memory address being used to hold the 4 value (i.e. 0x1000) by using the `&` character and using `*` to create an "integer pointer" type.

```c
int* y = &x;
```

The `y` variable will store the address pointed to by the `x `variable (0x1000).

!!! note
    The `*` character allows us to declare pointer variables but also allows us to access the value stored at a pointer. For example, entering `*y` allows us to access the 4 value instead of 0x1000.

Whenever we use the `y` variable we are using the memory address, but if we use the x variable we use the value stored at the memory address.

## Arrays

Arrays are a grouping of objects of the same type. They are typically created with the following syntax:

```c
type arrayName [ arraySize ];
```

To initialize values in the array we can do:

```c
int integers[ 10 ] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
```

Arrays allow programmers to group data into logical containers.

To access the indiviual elements of an array we access the contents by their "index". Most programming langauges today start counting from 0. So to take our previous example:

```c
int integers[ 10 ] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
/*     indexes        0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8   9
```

To access the value 6 we would use index 5:

```c
integers[5];
```

### How do arrays work?

Arrays are a clever combination of multiplication, pointers, and programming.

Because the computer knows the data type used for every element in the array, the computer needs to simply multiply the size of the data type by the index you are looking for and then add this value to the address of the beginning of the array.

For example if we know that the base address of an array is 1000 and we know that each integer takes 8 bytes, we know that if we have 8 integers right next to each other, we can get the integer at the 4th index with the following math:

```c
1000 + (4 * 8) =  1032
```

```c
array [ 1   , 2   , 3   , 4   , 5   , 6   , 7   , 8   ]
index   0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
addrs  1000  1008  1016  1024  1032  1040  1048  1056
```
