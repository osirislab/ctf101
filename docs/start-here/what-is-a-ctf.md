# What is a CTF?

Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions are the one stop shop for anyone who wishes to get into the world of computer security. Real-world vulnerabilities are featured in challenges that allow you to flex your programming, problem solving, and teamwork skills! CTFs bring these vulnerabilities right to your machine in small, compartmentalized challenges, fostering collaboration and community building (with friendly competition of course!). 

## Who can play in a CTF?
Participants can work individually or in teams to solve challenges. Typically, an organization would feature multiple members playing for the same team, working together to solve challenges. If you're working alone, we encourage you to do some searching or friendly recruiting to have another mind to bounce ideas off of!

## Do I need special tools or computers?
A terminal environment is essential to experiment and install tools in. Linux and MacOS systems should already have terminal emulators installed natively.

If you're on Windows, install Linux with [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or setup a VM ([virtual machine](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-virtual-machine)). See our [recommended software](https://ctf101.org/faq/recommended-software/).

    Images like [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms) come prebuilt with tools for all your pentesting needs!
