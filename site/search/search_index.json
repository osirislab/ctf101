Keys are assumed to be strings or numbers, not other dicts, so\n\ndeserializePrimative\n is used instead of \ndeserialize\n.\n\n\nThe problem is the if else on line 307. If it is not a number type, it assumes it is a string.\nIf we create a python object with a dict as a key, it will build it as a string.\n\n\nThis in itself isn't too useful, because we could create a malformed string normally,\nand have the same results. However, if we give it a real string, but set the type string to \"dict\",\nit will later on try to access the string as a hashtable.\n\n\nThis allows us to control pointers that the kernel module will follow. The place this is useful is\nin the makeCircular code (line 96).\n\n\nIf we create a fake bucket in userspace, which points to some kernelspace memory address,\nthis will write the address of the fake bucket to that kernelspace address. This gives us an\narbitrary write.\n\n\nWith SMEP on, we can attack \ncore_pattern\n. First we find the address of \ncore_pattern\n in \n/proc/kallsyms\n.\nThen we write \n|/tmp/a\n to that kernel address. This will cause the kernel to execute \n/tmp/a\n as root whenever a\nprogram dumps core.\n\n\nAll we need to do is write a shell script to get the flag in \n/tmp/a\n and cause a segfault.\n\n\nsol.c\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nEach team should get their own instance running the KWS back end. There is a main server that acts as the\nface of the web challenge, and will allow players to reboot/reset their instance (if they fuck up the kernel part)",

            "text": "The kernel module on the KWS instance implments a hashmap, with the ability to parse\npython objects out of userspace.  The supported objects are dict, string, and number.  When a dict is parsed from userspace, it assumes it is a json based dict and has a special case\nfor the keys of the dict. Keys are assumed to be strings or numbers, not other dicts, so deserializePrimative  is used instead of  deserialize .  The problem is the if else on line 307. If it is not a number type, it assumes it is a string.\nIf we create a python object with a dict as a key, it will build it as a string.  This in itself isn't too useful, because we could create a malformed string normally,\nand have the same results. However, if we give it a real string, but set the type string to \"dict\",\nit will later on try to access the string as a hashtable.  This allows us to control pointers that the kernel module will follow. The place this is useful is\nin the makeCircular code (line 96).  If we create a fake bucket in userspace, which points to some kernelspace memory address,\nthis will write the address of the fake bucket to that kernelspace address. This gives us an\narbitrary write.  With SMEP on, we can attack  core_pattern . First we find the address of  core_pattern  in  /proc/kallsyms .\nThen we write  |/tmp/a  to that kernel address. This will cause the kernel to execute  /tmp/a  as root whenever a\nprogram dumps core.  All we need to do is write a shell script to get the flag in  /tmp/a  and cause a segfault.  sol.c",

This document describes the protocol, lists some\n   of the implementations currently available, and has an overview of\n   how to implement new client and server applications.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n   This specification describes a modernized expression of the semantics\n   of the Gopher Internet protocol, referred to as Gopher version 2\n   (Gopher/2).\n\n   This specification obsoletes version 1 of the Internet Gopher\n   Protocol.\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\n   The Internet Gopher protocol is a wildly successful protocol.\n   It is currently the primary communications mechanisms for people\n   across the world. However it is missing several core mechanisms\n   for guaranteeing security. Additionally, it is lacking capabilities\n   for user interfaces and modern web document formatting.\n\n   The Gopher/2 defines a key exchange protocol for safe, end-to-end\n   encryption. Additionally, it defines a GopherText format for rendering\n   webpages.\n\n   The Internet Gopher/2 protocol and software follow a client-server\n   model. This model assumes reliable data stream; TCP is assumed.\n   Gopher/2 servers should listen on port 433. Documents reside on many\n   autonomous servers on the Internet. Users run client software on\n   their desktop, connecting to a server and completing a verification\n   process before sending the server a selector (a line of text, which\n   may not be empty) via a TCP connection at a well-known port. The server\n   responds with a block of text and closes the connection.\n\n   Servers return documents. The first line of the response contains the\n   type of the document and 4-byte big endian length of the document encoded in\n   hex and subsequent lines contain the contents of the document terminated by\n   end of file.\n\n   The GopherText format contains a list of Gopher/2 routes which the\n   client will then recursively request.\n\n\n2. The Internet Gopher/2 Model\n   Gopher/2 provides an optimized transport for Gopher semantics.\n   It supports all of the core features of Gopher but aims to be more\n   secure in several ways.\n\n   In essence, the Gopher protocol consists of a client connecting to a\n   server and sending the server a selector (a line of text, which may not\n   be empty) via a TCP connection.\n\n\n3. Gopher/2 Protocol Overview\n\n   In this simple example, the client establishes a connection and\n   requests the base page of the server.\n\n    {Client and server negotiate encryption key (See section 3.1)}\n    Client: {Sends a single forward slash Meaning \nList what you have\n}\n    /\n    Server: {Sends a series of lines, each ending in CR LF}\n    P17\n    T Welcome to our page\n    {Server closes connection}\n\n\n3.1. Connection Handshake\n\n   Connection will be established with a diffie-hellman key exchange.\n   This will establish the encryption key for subsequent communication\n   between client and server.\n\n   In the diffie-hellman exchange, let p = 251 and g = 6\n\n  Client: {Opens connection to web.chal.csaw.io at port 433 and\n           sends diffie-hellman A value.}\n  Server: {Accepts connection and says diffie hellman B value}\n  {Communication continues with messages encrypted by coordinated key}\n\n   The communication will be encrypted with repeated key xor using the\n   shared secret established by diffie hellman.\n\n\n3.2. Client Requests\n\n   Media item requests:\n\n  \nSelector\n    \nKey/Values...\n\n  /asdffile     Token1:ade912e4912b1c ...\n\n\n3.3. Server responses\n\n   The first line in a server response will be the item type followed by\n   the length of the return value encoded in hex. Subsequent lines will\n   be the content of the page. The following are the server response\n   types.\n\n  P   Item is a GopherText page\n  G   Item is a GIF format graphics file.\n  I   Item is some kind of image file.\n  S   Item is sound file (especially the WAV format).\n  F   Item is a file.\n\n\n   In the following example, the client requests a page on the server\n   with a token as an argument. The page the server returns will have a\n   Gopher2 media file in it. The client will reestablish another\n   connection to get the contents from the server.\n\n  {Client and server negotiate encryption key (See section 3.1)}\n  Client: {Sends magic string and session tokens}\n  /index username:uname sessionToken:eae12ade\n  Server: {Sends a series of lines, each ending in CR LF}\n  P41\n  T Welcome to our page, uname\n  I /imagename/png web.chal.csaw.io  433\n  {Connection closes}\n\n  {Client and server negotiate encryption key (See section 3.1)}\n  Client: {Sends a request for the image}\n  /imagename/png  username:uname sessionToken:eae12ade\n  Server: {Responds with file type and contents of PNG}\n  IDEAD\n  .PNG....\n  {Connection closes}\n\n\n4. GopherText Pages\n\n   The client software decides what items are available by looking at the\n   first character of each line in a directory listing. Augmenting this\n   list can extend the protocol.\n\n\n4.1. GopherText Static Text Types\n   A list of defined item-type characters. The client will decide how to\n   handle distinctions between text types.\n\n   Text type is formatted as follows:\n\n  \nItem Type\n \nText\n\n\n   The following are the available text types:\n\n  T   Text\n  E   Error\n\n\n4.2. GopherText Media Types\n\n   Used as this:\n\n  \nItem Type\n \nSelector\n \nHostname\n       \nPort\n \nKey/Values...\n\n  I           /asdf/png  web.chal.csaw.io 433    Token1:a912e4912b1c ...\n\n  Where the Selector also defines how the client will download the file.\n  E.g. /asdf/png will be downloaded as asdf.png\n  The client is disallowed from downloading files above the client\ns directory\n  for security purposes.\n\n   These are the following media item types.\n\n  G   Item is a GIF format graphics file. Client fetches and decides how\n       to display.\n  I   Item is some kind of image file. Client fetches and decides how to\n       display.\n  S   Item is sound file (especially the WAV format). Client will fetch\n       and play.\n  F   Item is a file. Client will fetch and download.\n  L   Item is a link to another Gopher/2 page.\n  P   Item is a nested browsing context. Client will fetch and render\n      as nested client.\n\n\n4.3. Session Storage Types\n\n   GopherText pages can return session storage entries to set Session\n   cookies on the client. The client will store it and append it to other\n   requests to the same server.\n\n  C  \nKey\n:\nValue\n        \nKey\n:\nValue\n       ...\n  C  Token1:Token1Value   Token2:Token2Value  ...\n\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\n   Gopher/2 addresses security issues by defining standards for\n   implementation of it\ns client and server with emphasis on cutting-edge\n   best advancements for cyber-security such as cyber-security through\n   obscurity, cyber-security through litigation, and cyber-security\n   through libel.\n\n\nExamples\n\n   An example implementation of Gopher/2 is available at\n\n      gopher://web.chal.csaw.io\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag\n\n\nflag{yeahsothatwasl!terallyjust100linesofpython!!!!!!!}\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nsolver.py\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nconfig goes into .env\nPART_TWO_PORT\nPART_TWO_HOSTNAME\nPORT\nHOSTNAME\nHave to be set correctly for the challenges to mesh together correctly\nHost on PORT 433 PLEASE\nInternally hosted on 433\nrun \n./setup",
